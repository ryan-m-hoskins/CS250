    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    Interpreting user needs can be done be effecitvely reviewing user stories. User stories are helpful because they provide a valid use case of the feature in the application, which can effectively convey how a feature will be used, why it's important, and what sort of constraints of general workflow is needed to accomplish it. 
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    Developing a program can start by first understanding user needs. Understanding user needs can lead to the ability to break down the project into parts that are easier to digest and tackle. Once each component has been created or established, work can be prioritized and planned for accordingly. At this stage, iterative development can be implemented into the project and feedback provided. There are so many ways to incorporate agile processes into development work - if it is appropriate. I don't believe Agile should be incorporated and forced into everything - it's not a magic bullet that is better than everything. With that said, SCRUM and adaptive planning can be incredibly helpful for some development work. 
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    Being a good team member honestly transcends agile and scrum. You can have a team of people that all use Scrum and Agile, but if they're not passionate or have the incentive to do their best, Agile isn't going to do much for them. Or, you can have a team of incredibly passionate developers that aren't using agile, and they will almost always perform better than a team that is using it if they're not passionate about it. So being a good team member means communicating, being transparent, and passionately pursuing the project.
